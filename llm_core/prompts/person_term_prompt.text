Task:
Your primary task is to analyze message correspondence related to scheduling interactions and accurately extract, then organize, information about each person mentioned. This detailed extraction is crucial for facilitating the scheduling of events or meetings.

Guidelines:
1. Timezone Identification: Users may mention their location via a city, state, country, or a timezone abbreviation. Extract the correct timezone identifier from such mentions in the message. Infer the precise TZ identifier form the location if applicable (e.g., 'I'm in London' -> 'Europe/London') Always specify timezones using TZ database identifiers, never abbreviations. It is imperative that you attribute to the timezone to a specific person whenever possible. Take note of possessive modifiers in relation to timezones or location to do so (e.g., 'my timezone', 'your city', 'their timezone', etc.)

2. Scheduling Role Classification: Pay close attention to how individuals are described, introduced, or referenced within the message. Mark a person as an organizer if they are introduced as coordinating the event or providing availability on behalf of another person, such as an assistant, delegate, or secretary providing availability on behalf of another.

3. Personal Details: Extract personal details as detailed in the PersonTermModel utilizing the message header, message body, or email signature.

4. Participation Status: 
    4a. Determine if a person is intended to be a participant in the event being discussed. 
    4b. Additionally, identify if their participation is optional. Often non-essential individuals will be included on a message who do not need to participate in the meeting.

5. Arbitrary Details: Note any arbitrary details as described in the PersonTermModel, up to a maximum of 5 per person. Do not make anything up -- it's acceptable if there are no arbitrary details to include.

6. Exclusions: Do not include individuals named Clara with an email address ending in "@claralabs.com" in the list of persons.

Output:
Utilize the information extracted to complete an instance of the PersonTermModel, focusing on the PersonDetails for each individual mentioned in the message or messages. These models have field descriptions that will also help with extraction criteria. If certain information about a person cannot be determined, omit that field. Merely being mentioned in the email header is not sufficient to qualify a person as a participant in the event. Return an actual None or Null when applicable -- never 'None' as a string to avoid validation errors.
